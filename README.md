# UE4-Game-with-parallel-concepts

University project made for parallel computing programing course, where I designed a game that usees parallel programing concepts like threads and prarallel execution for AIs.
The game is simple, the Player has to collect points to decrypt a code while running from enemies that follow him from 3 to 3 seconds.
You win if you find the code.
You lose if the enemies catch you.
